## Project Overview

The Monitoring plugin, developed by Davide Mirra, is a crucial component for Claudia Giacomozzi's C4D project. This plugin provides advanced monitoring features within the Moodle environment, generating insightful line graphs based on specific input parameters.

## Description

The [surveypro module](https://github.com/kordan/moodle-mod_surveypro.git) has been enriched with a simple plotting tool, allowing the monitoring of parameters successively delivered by a compiler at different time points. It is especially useful when a survey is continuously proposed to a compiler to follow the change of one or more parameters. For example, within an intervention on a patient aimed at reducing obesity, a survey might be administered weekly to collect body weight. At each survey submission, the patient (and the clinician) can see graphically the progress and the impact of the intervention on body weight.
